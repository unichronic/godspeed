Below is a Python program that prints a pyramid pattern of height 5:\n\n```python\ndef print_pyramid(height):\n    for i in range(height):\n        # Print leading spaces\n        for j in range(height - i - 1):\n            print(\" \", end=\"\")\n        \n        # Print stars\n        for k in range(2 * i + 1):\n            print(\"*\", end=\"\")\n        \n        # Move to the next line\n        print()\n\n# Print a pyramid of height 5\nprint_pyramid(5)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output the following pyramid pattern:\n\n```\n    *\n   ***\n  *****\n *******\n*********\n```\n\nThis program works by using nested loops to print the appropriate number of spaces and stars for each row of the pyramid. The outer loop controls the row, the first inner loop prints the leading spaces, and the second inner loop prints the stars."}
